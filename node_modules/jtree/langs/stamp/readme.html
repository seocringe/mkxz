<p class="scrollParagraph">You can also play with writing your own stamp files by hand in this <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20stamp">web IDE</a> to see autocomplete, type checking, and the full grammar.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">QuickStart: How to use Stamp in Node</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Stamp can be used in node to turn a folder on disk into a single stamp file, and to expand a single stamp file into a folder on disk.</p>
</div>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">npm install jtree</code>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">const stamp = require("jtree/products/stamp.nodejs.js")
// Convert a folder to a stamp string:
const stampString = stamp.dirToStampWithContents(__dirname)
// Expand a stamp to disk
new stamp(`file hello-world.txt`).execute()</code>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">How to use Stamp with other languages</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A Stamp file is a simple declarative file. It should be straightforward to write a Stamp "library" (really, 2 functions should suffice), in other languages. If you do that, please send a PR with a link so we can direct people without nodejs to other implementations.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">About</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Stamp is an alternative to zip files for sharing a small collection of folders and text files.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A Stamp Program is an easily readable plain text program that when executed creates the files and folders listed.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Stamp Programs are great for workflows where you prompt a user for input and then do a simple find/replace throughout the created files and folders.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Frequently programmers have templates that they start new projects with. Those templates can be turned into Stamp files.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">The Problem</h3>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The web is full of project tutorials like <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/creating-node-modules">this one</a> that ask their readers to go through a series of steps to create a particular folder and file structure for a new project.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The current options for this situation are:</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">The Recipe Method - explain each step</h3>
</div>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Downside: If your basic project layout requires 10 files, that's 10 separate steps the reader has to do just to get started.</li>
<li >Downside: The reader might make an error during one of those steps and lose even more time.</li>
<li >Downside: Putting such steps in a narrative and updating that narrative if things change is time consuming as an author</li></ul>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">The Zip Method - zip the template directory</h3>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Downside: zip files are opaque and a user has no visibility into what they are creating</li>
<li >Downside: everytime the template changes, author has to rezip and reupload the folder</li>
<li >Downside: once unzipped, user has to manually change names to match the name of their project</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">The Custom Utility Method - implement a custom command line program that generates new projects*</h3>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Downside: No visibility into what is getting created</li>
<li >Downside: If the template changes, now author needs to get users to install the new template program</li>
<li >Downside: Now you have a whole new complicated program to write and maintain</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">The GitHub method - create a repo for your template and have people git clone it</h3>
<ul style="text-indent:0px;"><li >Downside: no way of doing variable replacement post-clone</li>
<li >Downside: no plain text way of distributing the template</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h3 class="scrollParagraph">Alternatives Considered</h3>
